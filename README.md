# Bachelorarbeit

In this Bachelor Thesis I acieved the correspondence between the RGB and IR/Depth_Image coming from the Micorsoft Kinect v2
by distorting them, doing a perspective transformation and finally cropping them. 

With that beeing done, I caluclated plane equations by doing a linear least sqaure method for parts of the point cloud. 
The part is selected by klcking onto the correspdoning RGB-image. Finally everthing is implemented into a GUI
